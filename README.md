# Spellblade
This is a mod for the game [Kinky Dungeon](https://ada18980.itch.io/kinky-dungeon/), by Strait Laced Games LLC. [(GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Ada18980/KinkiestDungeon/)

The mod adds a new class to the game called the Spellblade, inspired by various concepts such as the Red Mage from Final Fantasy, the Sheen item from League of Legends, and the Warlock from D&D 5e.

## Mod Features

This mod adds the Spellblade class to the list of classes when creating a character. It is also available as a multiclass option.
* You start with 125 MP and SP, plus the upgrade Vault.
* Starting Weapon - Foil

### Core Feature - Spellweaver

Whenever a Spellweaver casts a spell, they gain a Spellweaver charge. This grants additional damage to your next melee attack, the type of which depends upon the spell's school.
* Elemental spells grant a charge that deals damage of that element. (Fire, Ice, etc.)
* Bondage spells grant a charge that deals chain damage and applies bondage.
* Utility schools grant a charge that deals generic blast damage.

With the upgrade **Hexed Blade**, your Spellweaver charges gain additional effects, or deal more damage.  For example:
* Fire Spellweaver deals 33% additional damage.
* Ice Spellweaver will slow the target on-hit, or freeze the target if already slowed.
* Summon Spellweaver will summon a ghostly ally in a cool hat.

All effects are in the description when you hover over the buff's tooltip.

### High Mobility Attacks

The Spellweaver is a mobility focused class, and as such has tools to get in and out of combat quickly.
* *Flèche* is a gapcloser melee strike to help you use your Spellweaver charges. With the Fancy Footwork upgrade, it can dash through an enemy in melee range.
* *Displacement* lets you backflip away from a target as you strike them. With the Fancy Footwork upgrade, it also applies vulnerable if you target an attacking enemy.

### Other Features

This list isn't meant to be exhaustive, but the Spellweaver has additional spells to assist you in your blade and spell weaving efforts.
* *Arcane Synergy* gives you a discount on your next spell after successfully using a Spellweaver charge.
* *Bound Weapon* lets you choose a weapon to bond with. It has reduced SP costs, plus the ability to strike while bound by using a Spellweaver charge.
* *Blade Twirl* blocks all projectiles until the end of turn. If you do, you gain a Spellweaver charge of its type. This can potentially grant one that you cannot obtain normally.
* And more!

## Uninstallation
Uninstalling the mod is mostly safe.  Your existing Spellblade saves won't crash the game post-uninstallation; you'll just see a \[Not Found\] text string in place of your class name.  They should still load, but you won't have any class abilities anymore, and might run into unexpected bugs.
