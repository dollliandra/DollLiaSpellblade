# Spellblade
This is a mod for the game [Kinky Dungeon](https://ada18980.itch.io/kinky-dungeon/), by Strait Laced Games LLC. [(Game GitHub Repo)](https://github.com/Ada18980/KinkiestDungeon/)

The mod adds a new class to the game called the Spellblade, inspired by various concepts such as the Red Mage from Final Fantasy, the Sheen item from League of Legends, and the Warlock from D&D 5e.

## Mod Features

This mod adds the Spellblade class to the list of classes when creating a character.
* You start with 125 MP and SP, plus the upgrade Vault.
* Starting Weapon - Foil
* Additionally, you can multiclass into a Spellblade when selecting perks.

### Core Feature - Spellweaver

Whenever a Spellweaver casts a spell, they gain a Spellweaver charge. This grants additional damage to your next melee attack, the type of which depends upon the spell's school.
* Elemental spells grant a charge that deals damage of that element. (Fire, Ice, etc.)
* Bondage spells grant a charge that deals chain damage and applies bondage.
* Utility schools grant a charge that deals generic blast damage.

With the upgrade **Hexed Blade**, your Spellweaver charges gain additional effects, or deal more damage.  For example:
* Fire Spellweaver deals 33% additional damage.
* Ice Spellweaver will slow the target on-hit, or freeze the target if already slowed.
* Summon Spellweaver will summon a ghostly ally who wields a foil and a cool hat.

### High Mobility Attacks

The Spellweaver is a mobility focused class, and as such has tools to get in and out of combat quickly.
* Flèche is a gapcloser melee strike, but with the Fancy Footwork upgrade, can dash through an enemy in melee range.
* Displacement lets you backflip away from a target as you strike them.
